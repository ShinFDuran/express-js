# Express Server Boilerplate

The idea of this repository is to create a boilerplate of an API REST using Express.

## Requirements

One of the ideas is use async/await in this project or at least allow it. This mean we are using ES8 functionality and we need that the Node version be at least **7.6** to have official support for async / await enabled by default.

## Objectives

This is a list of features that I would like implement as a base in the server.

1. Good folder structure
2. Use nodemon (maybe Webpack in the future) to auto reload the server
3. Use a system to have logs and more possibilities to show info in console
4. Have a system to load environment variables
5. Use of classes to have models of objects
6. Routing system as an API REST server with sub-routers mounted
7. Authentication using JWT
8. Unit tests
9. Error handling
10. Documentation with JSDoc or similar
